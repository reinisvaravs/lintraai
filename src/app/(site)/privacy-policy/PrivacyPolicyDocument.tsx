        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you&#39;re a customer of a business using SetInbound, your data is
        handled on behalf of that business. In legal terms, we act as a
        &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; and they are the &ldquo;data

        services ever handle such data, we will update this policy and apply
        stricter compliance standards.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. How We Collect Data</h2>
      <ul className="list-inside list-disc">

      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">4. Call Recording Notice</h2>
      <p>
        By default, our AI agents record calls for quality, training, and
        operational purposes. We may notify callers at the start of the call
        (e.g., &ldquo;This call may be recorded...&rdquo;) depending on local
        law. If you do not wish to be recorded, please inform the agent or hang
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also support our clients with suggested consent scripts for their
        callers and recommend using a notice such as &ldquo;This call may be
        recorded for quality and scheduling purposes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Recordings and transcriptions are stored temporarily and delivered to
        the client via their own integrations (e.g., CRM or calendar tools).

      <p>
        We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide services,
        fulfill legal requirements, or troubleshoot performance. For client call
        recordings and appointment data, we retain them only while we actively
        work on the client&#39;s project and delete them upon project completion
        or handoff, unless otherwise agreed. For demo interactions on our
        website, we keep data until no longer needed or until deletion is
        requested.
