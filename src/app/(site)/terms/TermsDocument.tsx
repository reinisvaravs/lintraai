      <p>
        These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and
        use of the AI receptionist services provided by{" "}
        <strong>SIA Vāravi</strong>, a Latvian limited company (registration no.
        123456789) trading as SetInbound (&ldquo;SetInbound&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;). By using our
        services, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">1. Services Provided</h2>
      <p>
        SetInbound offers voice-based AI receptionist services for
        appointment-based businesses. Our service includes creating,
        configuring, and deploying AI voice agents that can receive calls, book
        appointments, transfer data to CRMs or databases, and integrate with
        third-party platforms (such as CRMs, calendars, or phone systems).
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not handle client payments or financial transactions on your
        behalf.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">2. Data Ownership & Processing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Client data ownership:</strong> You own all data processed by
        your AI receptionist, including call recordings, logs, and contact
        details collected during its use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data storage:</strong> We configure the AI receptionist to store
        data in your own designated platforms (e.g., your CRM or database). We
        do not permanently store or reuse your data beyond what is technically
        required for setup, testing, or maintenance during the period of our
        active service. Once your project is completed and handed off, we
        permanently delete any data remaining with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Demo AI:</strong> If you interact with our demonstration agent
        on setinbound.com, any data you submit (such as phone numbers, names, or
        messages) will be processed and stored by SetInbound. We reserve the
        right to store these demo interactions until they are no longer needed
        for quality, improvement, and support, or until you request deletion.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you require a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), we can provide one
        upon request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> As a client, you are responsible for
        informing your callers that calls are recorded and for complying with
        any applicable laws about recording or monitoring phone conversations.
        We can provide example consent scripts for your callers upon request to
        help you comply with recording laws.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
      <p>
        Our AI receptionist depends on integrations with third-party platforms
        (including Retell.ai, Make.com, CRM tools, or telephony providers). We
        do not control these providers and are not responsible for their
        performance, downtime, or failures. You agree that we may change or
        replace third-party integrations at our discretion to maintain service
        continuity.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">
        4. Free Trial, Payment, and Cancellation
      </h2>
      <p>
        We offer a 3-day free trial (72 hours) from the agreed launch time of
        your AI receptionist. To activate the trial, you place a &euro;500
        refundable soft deposit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you cancel in writing to{" "}
        <a
          href="mailto:hello@setinbound.com"
          className="text-blue-600 underline"
        >
          hello@setinbound.com
        </a>{" "}
        within the first 72 hours, you may request a full refund of the deposit.
        After cancellation, all related configurations, data, and assets will be
        permanently deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not cancel within 72 hours, the &euro;500 deposit becomes
        non-refundable and will be applied to your total service fee. You will
        then be invoiced for the remaining amount, and ongoing support and
        optimization will continue once payment is received.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">
        5. Service Availability & Support
      </h2>
      <p>
        SetInbound aims for high availability but does not guarantee
        uninterrupted or error-free service. We depend on third-party providers
        whose outages or interruptions are beyond our control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Support is provided on a commercially reasonable efforts basis, without
        any guaranteed response times.

      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you breach
        these terms or if you fail to pay invoices when due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participation in any referral program is subject to separate referral
        terms, available upon request.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All systems, prompts, scripts, and configurations we create for you
        belong to you, once delivered and paid for. The demonstration AI agent
        and its configurations remain the property of SetInbound.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        SetInbound provides its services &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and to the maximum
        extent permitted by law disclaims all warranties, including any implied
